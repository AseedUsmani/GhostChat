Self-destruct chatting application

This is India's first self-destruct multimedia chatting app.
Feel free to clone and enhance it. Push requests will be appreciated

The app. uses parse.com for the backend server.
You have to sign up using your Email ID with a unique username and a password, or recover your password, or login to your existing account. Once you have logged in, you can check your inbox, friendlist, add/remove friends, send your friends self-destruct message in the form of text, image or videos; which would be deleted once they view it. Previously, the application had a self-destruct timer, due to which the media messages would be deleted in 10 seconds, once they are viewed; but this feature had to be removed because a lot of users may be using 2G network. You also have the option to change your password (given that you are already logged in).
